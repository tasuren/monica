# Monica: On-screen anotation software
This software allows you to draw and highlight directly on your screen.  
Enhance your presentations, online meetings, and educational content by easily adding notes and drawings on the fly.

- **Simple UI** — Simple and non-multifunctional.
- **Cross-platform** — It supports Windows and macOS. Also it will supports Linux (WIP).
- **Tiny single executable** — Thanks to tauri, the executable file is less than 10MB.
